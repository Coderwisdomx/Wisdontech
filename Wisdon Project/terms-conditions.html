<h2>3. Repair Service Terms</h2>

<h3>Device Inspection and Diagnosis</h3>
<p>When you submit a device for repair, we will perform a diagnostic inspection to identify issues. You will receive a repair estimate including labor costs and parts replacement fees. Repair proceeds only upon your written approval.</p>

<h3>Warranty on Repairs</h3>

<li>Unauthorized modifications</li>
<li>Water damage or liquid exposure</li>
<li>Software issues unrelated to our repair</li>
<li>Pre-existing conditions not disclosed</li>

<h3>Price Promise</h3>
<p>We guarantee fair and transparent pricing. If you find a defect or issue after purchase within 30 days, we will address it at no extra cost.</p>

<h2>5. Trade-In Program</h2>
<p>Our trade-in program allows customers to exchange old devices for credit toward new purchases. Device valuation is based on market value, condition, and functionality. Once a trade-in is accepted and payment processed, the device becomes our property.</p>

<li>Indirect, incidental, or consequential damages</li>
<li>Third-party claims related to devices</li>
<li>Delays in repair or service delivery</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Data Protection</h2>
<p>During repair, your device may be accessed for diagnosis. We commit to protecting your privacy and not accessing personal data beyond what is necessary for repair. For sensitive devices, you may request data wiping before repair.</p>
